  No snark intended, but you can always count on Conde Nast Traveler for a bit of the luxurious. This time, writer Janssen Bradshaw served up five tips for bringing little ones to (in)famous museums and cultural institutions (you can read the post <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-10-03/how-to-make-museums-fun-for-kids?mbid=tumblr">here)</a>. Museums represent awesome (in all 19th century landscape-painting amazing senses of the word) learning opportunities. That said, it is hard to get kiddos interested in them sometimes, and the tips Bradshaw gave are really great for bringing little ones along and pacifying them while you enjoy the museum.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to give you a couple more ideas – perhaps ones that might offer some learning opportunities for the kids and the adults! Read on to see my recommendations on the best kid’s museums across America – these aren’t going to bore the adults, either.
</p>
<p>
  1. Remember that a child’s age is going to affect how they interact with the museum exhibits. Think about the last time you went to an art museum – most frames and pedestals start around the normal height of a 5-7 year old kiddo. That means kids that age will be walking around seeing the bottom of frames, and none of the beautiful sights. If you’ve got a kid around that age, consider hoisting them up on your shoulders for a few minutes in every big room, or actually getting a stroller for them even if normally they’re a bit old for it. Adults will get to interact with kids if they’re willing to talk with them about what they see from different vantage points.

  2. Kids like to touch things – so offer them something to hold onto. Ideally, bring a few (non-noisy) toys, perhaps something related to the place you’re visiting. Going to an art museum? Bring some clean, dry paint brushes for them to hold. Headed to a science center? You’re likely to find more kid-friendly activities there, but bring a chinese finger toy just in case. History museum? Bring along a doll or action figure – they can act out scenes in the exhibits. As the big kid in the game, you get to talk with the little ones and encourage them to think about how their toys might be related to what they’re seeing.

  3. Bring index cards and one of those paper-only markers (there a few brands that make them) or a pencil and ask kids to draw their favorite scene – be it a picture, a dinosaur, or history exhibit. You can do a variant of this and make it a scavenger hunt before you go: do a little research on the exhibits you’ll see, write out 5-6 things to look for on individual cards, and have the kids look for them throughout the outing.
</p>

  I can’t say that I’ve taken my own kids (don’t have them yet!) to a museum, but I certainly have facilitated many museum learning experiences with kids. I’ve also dragged – sometimes willingly and sometimes not-so-willingly – three younger siblings to my favorite museums and figured out ways to entertain them and educate them. What are some of the ways you’ve engaged kids in museums?
</p>

  I'm so thrilled to be sharing this with you right now. This post marks the beginning of a journey I've wanted to start for years, and to start it with you is absolutely humbling.

  Edify Education Design represents my way of supporting a changing world, and "being the change I wish to see" too. First things first: want to lay out a couple of things about Edify and about this blog (managing expectations is always key...!)

  You can expect a blog post about once a week, usually containing my thoughts on educational philosophy, great techniques, cool opportunities; that kind of stuff. This blog has closed comments, but if you'd like to share your thoughts with me, I'd love it! Send them to me at kristen@edifyedu.com.

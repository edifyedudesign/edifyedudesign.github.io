  We love learning because we love thinking about the future of things. Thinking about the future of things makes us wonder, consider, ponder… it makes us yearn for new ways to solve old problems. It makes us bend our minds around corners and possibilities and come up with magic possibilities. We love learning because it helps us come up with things like the future of the <a href="http://vimeo.com/15142335">book</a> from IDEO. The vision of that video is that books can help us reach into the past and create workable ideas for the future, specifically via books. It doesn’t always have to be a book though – sometimes it’s a song. Or a business card. Or a conversation. Or anything…

  Everything is learning. Everything has educational potential. Here at Edify, we love learning because we love thinking about the permutations of what can be done with education. Imagine a world more thoughtful, a world more richly colored. That’s the world Edify creates.

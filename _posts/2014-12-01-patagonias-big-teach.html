  Infographics have been pretty popular in the past few years, and they’re getting a little more customer-centric and sophisticated as time goes on. I think a great example of that sophistication is Patagonia’s partnership with <a href="http://championdontstop.com/site3/animations/PatagoniaDown/PatagoniaDown.html">Geoff McFetridge of Champion Studios</a>. The marketing campaign was geared at promoting Patagonia’s new “Farm to Jacket” down feather process, a more ethical and animal-centered process for gathering jacket stuffing. The charming infographic-cum-illustrated flowchart done by Geoff is actually a great example of an educational marketing tool, and here’s why.
</p>
<p>
  Patagonia is seeking to shed light on the typical market practices for gathering down and making jackets – jackets that consumers enjoy and pay quite a bit for. However, the practices that produce those jackets are often fairly cruel and unreasonable; Patagonia’s new triple-bottom-line clarity for their down-gathering process seeks to position them as the more socially and environmentally friendly outerwear company. Patagonia is already known for their amazing outdoors advocacy and campaigning, and this marketing effort only further solidifies their market control. So where’s the education piece? Well, by showing the customer how their process works, without mud-slinging their competition, they essentially taught the customer something new. I for one didn’t know the process of raising geese and getting down feathers, and I didn’t really want to know because I assumed it wasn’t very savory. The coordinated banner ads and video truly seek to be an educational tool that leverages Patagonia’s social and manufacturing position to be the best down jacket provider.

<p>
  By using imagery and process in a revealing, charming way, Patagonia successfully created a marketing piece that’s as much an educational tool as it is a sales tool. Businesses of all sorts can do the same – everyone from Whole Foods to your local insurance agent have done the same.
</p>
<p>
  So how can you follow in Patagonia’s footsteps? Businesses, freelancers, and nonprofits can all follow the same formula and introduce their own flair to this process and successfully produce educational marketing campaigns. Here’s how:
</p>
<p>
  1. Decide what you want to share – is it a new idea? new service? revealing industry secret? point of differentiation?
</p>
<p>
  2. Decide if and how you’ll use visual information – this is a great time to get to know a visual artist, sketchnote expert (I know several if you need one!) or cartoonist.
</p>
<p>
  3. Freewrite the chronological order of the information you want to share. Be sure to explain relationships between the key points (what comes first, how does it flow to the next item)
</p>
<p>
  4. Bring the written order of the points to the visual element and start creating imagery or icons that represent the story you’re trying to tell.
</p>
<p>
  5. Refine your concept and get feedback.
</p>
<p>
  6. Share it with the world – via social, print, or other media!

  <strong> Welcoming new employees doesn’t have to hurt.</strong></p>

  <p> The first day at a new job is always a time for excitement, perhaps a little anxiety, and a set of
  customs as familiar as the dishes served at Thanksgiving: meeting new coworkers, filling out HR  paperwork, settling into a workspace. But just as Thanksgiving dishes vary widely from table to table, each company’s onboarding experience is unique. And all too frequently, it seems, onboarding is far from helpful or satisfying for new employees.
  </p>
  <p>
  The cause of these less-than-ideal experiences isn’t hard
  to fathom. Designing and implementing an effective
  onboarding program can be difficult, especially for HR
  professionals facing seemingly endless demands for their
  finite time and resources. Successful onboarding requires
  employees at multiple levels of the company to
  participate in formal and informal teaching and
  mentoring. It requires a deep understanding of the
  company’s culture, and a plan for how to meaningfully
  impart those cultural priorities. And it requires the ability
  to carefully balance time spent on big-picture thinking
  with the natural desire to ramp up new employee time-to productivity as quickly as possible.

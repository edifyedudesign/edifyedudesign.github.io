Edify knows that healthy businesses have healthy employees, so we use a learning culture approach to design processes and tools that produce real results.</p>
            <p class="align-justify"><strong>If you're concerned about retention, performance, productivity, innovation, diversity, or flexibility, you're in the right place.</strong> Edify solves problems and eases transitions through a combination of learning design, management coaching, and organizational development.
            </p>
            <p class="align-justify">Our experience and knowledge has helped Edify create the Learning Culture Framework, a trademarked and proprietary process that helps companies see and utilize the big picture in their organizations while concurrently working on the supporting pieces. The LCF provides stability, direction, and support in times of change so that the entire organization can see benefit and gains.
            </p>
            <p class="align-justify">Clients work with Edify on a consulting project basis, through our in-company workshops, and through the Learning Culture Framework Kit for Teams.
